# Training for Probationary Lyrids

This is a compilation of the activities and projects given to probationary Lyrids of the Center for Complexity and Emerging Technologies (COMET) as partial requirement for promotion to cohort membership. 

**The projects in this compilation feature interactive maps and HTML markup. Since Github does not support dynamic displays for notebooks, it is necessary to download the projects to render the elements and to manipulate the data visualizations.**

# About COMET

The Center for Complexity and Emerging Technologies (COMET) is an interdisciplinary research laboratory under the Advanced Research Institute for Informatics, Computing, and Networking (AdRIC) at De La Salle University, Manila, Philippines. Its mission is to enhance understanding of emergent phenomena in real-life systems, sociotechnical systems, and human-computer interactions. It develops computational models which are then used in the design of interactive tools, information systems, and interaction techniques.
